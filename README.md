# project-manageable-app

Repository for my Flatiron Rails Portfolio Project. This Rails web application allows users to first create an account, and using an
MVC structure the user can manage projects across multiple teams. You can start a project solo or start a project as an admin or be invited to be a team member of another user's project.

## Getting Started

This app uses the gem 'puma' in production mode. To use this app, clone this repository, run 'bundle install --without production' to install the needed gems.

To seed the database with test/example data, run rake db:seed.

Run 'rails s', and copy http://localhost:3000 in your browser to launch the site locally.

To use this app, first create your user account, then create a team/add users and start creating projects. End server with ctrl + c.
