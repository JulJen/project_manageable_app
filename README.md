# project-manageable-app

Repository for my Flatiron Rails Portfolio Project. This Rails web application allows users to first create an account, and using an
MVC structure the user can manage projects across multiple teams. You can start a project solo or start a project as an admin or be invited to be a team member of another user's project.

## Getting Started

To use this app, clone this repository, run 'bundle install' to install the needed gems.

To seed the database with test/example data, run rake db:seed.

This app includes gem 'shotgun', run 'shotgun', and copy the url given in your browser to launch the site locally.

Create your user account and have fun! End server with ctrl + c.
